# react-native-bundle-discovery

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/retyui/react-native-bundle-discovery/pull/16) [`ac2af30`](https://github.com/retyui/react-native-bundle-discovery/commit/ac2af3063e3c4031ee026b58d4039e56f7152383) Thanks [@retyui](https://github.com/retyui)! - Rewrite in TypeScript and ship compiled JavaScript from `dist/` (with type definitions for `react-native-bundle-discovery` and the Rozenite plugin). Package entry points are unchanged; deep imports of internal files (e.g. `react-native-bundle-discovery/webpack.js`, `react-native-bundle-discovery-ui/.discoveryrc.js`) moved under `dist/`.
