**TODO:**
- [x] Search/filters
- [x] bug: Code size is diff. treemap != badge info (BECAUSE no duplicated modules in treemap)
- [ ] Diff page (to compare two versions bundle)
- [ ] Map based on the coverage (https://x.com/chromedevtools/status/1095411723161354240?lang=en)
- Static website (like  https://statoscope.tech)
    - [ ] website
    - [ ] auto deploy
    - [ ] drag and drop `stats.json`
- [x] Large tree maps https://www.highcharts.com/demo/highcharts/treemap-large-dataset or https://github.com/evmar/webtreemap
- Reports:
    - [ ] top 10 largest modules
    - [ ] top 10 largest files
    - [ ] Dead code detection (as example ios only code in an android bundle, never used exports, etc ...)
    - [x] Duplicate modules detection
    - [ ] Custom reports
